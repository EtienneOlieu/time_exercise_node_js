<h1 style=" color: goldenrod">IS IT VASILY ARKHIPOV DAY YET?</h1>

<div id="answer-div"></div>
<p>
    Vasily Arkhipov was an engineer and commodere of a group of russian submarines armed with nuclear torpedoes during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
</p>
<p>
    On October 27 1962 the submarines had been without contact with the surface for an extended period due to being submerged. 
    This worried the captain and the NCO who wanted to attack with their nuclear weapons as they thought the war had broken out.
    Vassily argued against this and after a long time he forced the submarines to surface where they were met by US destroyers.
    The submarines returned to Russia where the crew were debriefed and faced recriminations by the soviet state.
</p>
<p>
    It has been argued since that Vasily Arkhipov most likely saved the world from a nuclear war on that day.
